# TgCalls ARM UWP proof

This directory contains the reproducible native-source proof for the
experimental ARM UWP private-call transport. It does not package a TgCalls
binary, change `CallProtocol`, or replace the proven legacy `libtgvoip`
fallback.

## Source pin

The source checkout is intentionally external to this repository:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\UnigramTdlibExperiment\tgcalls
```

It is pinned to:

```text
TelegramMessenger/tgcalls@1c236c09f8d8569fead14bd68000618a52051225
```

That revision's `InstanceImpl` registers the actual current private-call
versions `2.7.7` (protocol V0) and `5.0.0` (protocol V1). Those values must
not be advertised by the experimental app until a matching native transport
has been built and packaged.

## Reproducible probe

From the app repository, run:

```powershell
.\build\tgcalls\Test-TgCallsUwpArm.ps1
```

The probe initializes the installed VS 2017 v141 ARM compiler environment and
compiles `tgcalls\Instance.cpp`, then attempts the real V0/V1
`tgcalls\InstanceImpl.cpp` unit. It verifies the exact source commit before
compiling and removes its temporary object files.

At the pinned revision, metadata compilation succeeds, while the private-call
engine stops at:

```text
fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'rtc_base/logging.h'
```

This is expected: the upstream checkout contains neither WebRTC headers nor
ARM UWP WebRTC libraries, and it has no UWP CMake or Visual Studio project.
The `tgcalls\platform\uwp` sources are not a build system; their capture code
also belongs to the deferred video scope.

The installed vcpkg revision (`98d7cb0cf1f4686a3e43aa5672b6230c1d56bce8`)
rejects `webrtc:arm-uwp` during its dry-run dependency plan because the port
supports desktop Windows, not UWP. The current `UnigramDev/Unigram`
`Telegram.Native.Calls` component confirms the required modern bridge exists,
but its dedicated UWP WebRTC port deliberately supports only x64 and ARM64.
Neither route supplies an ARM Windows Mobile library.

After supplying a source-compatible WebRTC checkout, repeat the probe with:

```powershell
.\build\tgcalls\Test-TgCallsUwpArm.ps1 -WebRtcRoot C:\path\to\webrtc\src
```

The required WebRTC build must target Windows Store ARM with the app's
Windows 10 SDK 18362 constraints and provide the matching headers, generated
configuration, static libraries, and UWP-compatible audio/network
implementations. It must be built or ported from source; headers alone do not
constitute a transport proof.

## Integration gate

Only after the probe and a linked ARM C++/CX WinMD proof pass may a new
component be introduced. It must expose audio-only lifecycle, encryption,
reflector/WebRTC server configuration, signaling, routing, state callbacks,
and a version list; `CallsService` must select it only for the versions it
actually implements. The existing ARM `libtgvoip` wrapper stays in place as
the validated W10M legacy fallback. Video remains out of scope.

TgCalls is LGPL-3.0. Before distributing any resulting APPX, preserve the
upstream license and source pin, publish required notices and corresponding
source for modifications, and complete a licensing review of the component
linkage and redistribution terms.

## ARM WebRTC source build

`UnigramDev/webrtc-uwp` carries the needed `winuwp` platform changes, but its
published archives intentionally omit 32-bit ARM. The external
`UnigramDev/deps@6ce0019e1e5ea4e06ab3bc21651242567774a4e0` build script
pins the UWP fork at
`801b01361857fd9afd40f0efd29034b0e48001c7` and its WebRTC source branch at
`branch-heads/6312`.

Run the experimental wrapper with VS 2022 ARM C++ Build Tools installed:

```powershell
.\build\tgcalls\Build-WebRtcUwpArm.ps1
```

It verifies the external build-script revision, selects a Visual Studio
instance with the ARM workload, and injects `arm` into the script's published
x64/ARM64 architecture allow-list only in a temporary copy. The external
script and its pinned upstream source remain unmodified. The default build
root is deliberately short (`C:\wrtcar`): Chromium's third-party checkout
contains paths that exceed Windows' legacy limit under the longer
`%LOCALAPPDATA%` location. It downloads `depot_tools`, synchronizes
approximately 20 GB of WebRTC dependencies, then generates
`target_os="winuwp"` and `target_cpu="arm"` before building `webrtc.lib`.
This operation can take several hours.

The generated library is only a native proof input. It must still compile and
link with the audio-only C++/CX TgCalls bridge, activate from its WinMD, and
complete device interoperability before it can replace any packaged transport.
